// controls incremental vibration in games that require searching for POIs
// TODO: Needs logic to:
  // Track player location relative to POI
  // Adjust vibration intensity based off distance
  // terminate vibration if all POIs collected
  // If a group of POIs, provide vibration intensity for nearest
  // Terminate vibration if game is ended early
